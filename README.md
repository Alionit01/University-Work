# University-Work
Welcome to my university life repository! This is a personal collection of everything I’ve worked on during my studies, including:

Code projects: From small coding exercises to larger course projects.
Assignments: Solutions and documentation for various subjects.
Documents and Notes: My personal study notes and helpful resources.
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my work and progress, both for personal growth and to share with classmates and potential employers. As I continue my journey through university, I’ll be updating this space with new projects, assignments, and learning materials.

Feel free to explore and see how my skills evolve over time!
