# Java Client-Server Communication

A simple Java application demonstrating basic client-server communication using sockets. This project provides a foundational understanding of networking concepts such as socket programming, input/output streams, and message passing between two programs over a network.

##  Project Overview

This project includes two main components:
- **Client**: Connects to the server, takes a message from the user, and sends it to the server. It then receives a response from the server and displays it.
- **Server**: Waits for a client to connect, receives a message from the client, and sends a response back to the client.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-client-server.git
   cd java-client-server
   ```
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   javac Client.java Server.java
   ```

### Usage

1. **Start the Server**
   - Run the `Server` program first to start listening for incoming connections:
     ```bash
     java Server
     ```
   - The server will print "Waiting for clients..." and stay ready to accept a connection.

2. **Start the Client**
   - Run the `Client` program to connect to the server:
     ```bash
     java Client
     ```
   - Enter a message when prompted, and the server will respond with an acknowledgment.

## ðŸ›  Code Explanation

### Client.java
- Establishes a socket connection to the server at `localhost` on port `9806`.
- Reads a message from the user via console input and sends it to the server.
- Receives and displays the serverâ€™s response.

### Server.java
- Listens on port `9806` for incoming client connections.
- Accepts a client connection, reads a message sent by the client, and responds with an acknowledgment.

## ðŸ“„ Example Output

### Server Output
```
Waiting for clients...
Connection Established
Received from client: Hello, Server!
```

### Client Output

Client started
Enter a message: Hello, Server!
Server response: Server: Hello, Server!


##  Improvements
This project can be expanded with additional features:
- Multiple clients support using threads.
- Enhanced exception handling and logging.

## Concepts Learned
- Socket programming
- Input and output streams in Java
- Basic client-server architecture

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of Java networking!
